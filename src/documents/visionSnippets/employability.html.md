The kind of humanities teaching that we propose will give Humanities students a unique profile, providing them with tools to innovate Humanities research as well as making them more employable. It will also provide a test-bed for new forms of online learning developed specifically for the needs of humanities teaching and learning. A programming course aimed specifically at humanities students, that combines practical assignments, theorectical discussions and critical reflection, where students develop their coding and research skills collaboratively, in this new learning and teaching environment, is the first step in achieving this vision.
