[Prof. Boast](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robin-boast/5/181/855) has been working for over thirty years in what today we call Digital Humanities. His work has focused on diverse topics, ranging from the first digital collection projects in museums and universities to the more recent emergence of the Web and social computing, to the question of digitality itself. His recent research has focused on local knowledge and emergent systems across incommensurable expert communities (indigenous and scientific), where he focuses on the study and development of open source, social and distributive systems.

Prof. Boast heads the Cultural Information Science programme in Media Studies at UvA and sits on the Board of ASCA.
