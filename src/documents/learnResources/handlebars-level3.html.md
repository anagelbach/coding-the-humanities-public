Handlebars is a templating language for HTML and JavaScript that makes it very easy to create dynamic web pages where the template parts of an HTML page are filled with content based on input provided by the user. From the template document you can make many document, based on data from another source.  For instance, you can generate web pages with images from a database, where the template makes sure that a page has a standard layout and style but adds the image requested by the user.  Handlebars provide simple syntax for templating, that is easy to understand
