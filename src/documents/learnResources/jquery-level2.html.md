jQuery is JavaScript library that makes it easier to select, create and manipulate elements in a web page. Navigating through a HTML document using plain JavaScript requires a lot code. With jQuery you can do the same navigating with short and simple statements, that are intuitive and result in cleaner and easier to understand code.
