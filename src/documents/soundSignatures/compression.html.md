> An mp3 takes an existing CD-quality digital audio file and removes as much
> data content as possible, relying on listener's bodies and brains to make
> up the difference. For example, a three-minute stereo CD file takes up about
> 30 megabytes of disk space; a three-minute mp3 of average quality takes up 3
> to 4 megabytes of disk space. This is accomplished through a variety of 
> **filters** and processes.
