> "The language of the raw and the cooked also permeates discourses of sound
> synthesis, where processing again figures as an expression of creative
> control. An oscillator generates a sound that is called raw until it is run 
> through filters, amplifiers, and other sound shapers."

(Sterne and Rodgers, 37)
